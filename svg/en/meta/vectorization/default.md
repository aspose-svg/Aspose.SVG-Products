qs[1].name: "How can I convert {{i18n.informat}} to SVG?"
qs[1].text: "Aspose.SVG allows you to convert {{i18n.informat}} to SVG in any way - online or programmatically. For example, you can vectorize {{i18n.informat}} in real-time using Online Image Vectorizer that converts your images quickly and with high quality. In other way, you can use Aspose.SVG for .NET API to vectorize {{i18n.informat}} programmatically."
qs[2].name: "What is the image vectorization for?"
qs[2].text: "Vector images are essential for any professional who works with drawings, graphics, or sketches. Many designers, printers, architects, and artists often choose to work with sketches or drawings as vector images. And they have good reasons! Unlike bitmap graphics, vector arts are resizable and scalable without losing any quality, and they will still display just as clearly. Also, vectorization can be used to update or recover images. Vector images are what you need to produce banners, logos, maps, signs, embroideries, engravings, graphs, blueprints, etc."
qs[3].name: "What is a raster to vector conversion?"
qs[3].text: "The process of image conversion from raster to vector is called image vectorization. It is a complex computational process that converts a bitmap image made up of pixels into a vector image made up of lines, curves, and other geometric shapes."

qs[1].name: "How can I convert text to vector?"
qs[1].text: "Aspose.SVG allows you vectorize SVG text in any way - online or programmatically. You can convert text to vector in real-time using Online Text to Vector application that transforms your texts in SVG file quickly and with high quality. In other way, you can use Aspose.SVG for .NET API to vectorize text programmatically."
qs[2].name: "What does text vectorization mean?"
qs[2].text: "In vectorized SVG text, all font glyphs are replaced by a combination of XML text tags such as  <path>, <use>, <g>, etc. The text is converted to vector shapes and cannot be edited. This prevents casual users from opening and editing this file in a text editor."
qs[3].name: "Why should I convert text to vector?"
qs[3].text: "Text vectorization protects text from simple copying, unwanted use, borrowing and modification. Vectorized text, being digital graphics, allows you to use a unique font without installing it on a client computer and retains its style when used in any computer environment. Text can be scaled while maintaining quality and apply any SVG effects to it."
