{{<section SVG>}}

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML-based text format to describe an image's appearance. In an SVG file, images are described as geometric primitives: lines, curves, shapes, text, etc. Vector objects are built and stored as a set of commands, numbers, formulas, and not in a pixel grid, as in bitmap images. The word Scalable refers to the fact that SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. A text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for website building and print graphics to achieve scalability. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.

{{<section JPEG>}}

A JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as a result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reducing the storage size. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. The JPEG algorithm is most effective for compressing photographs and paintings containing realistic scenes with smooth transitions in brightness and color. JPEG is most widely used in digital photography and for storing and transmitting images on the Web. Almost all Operating systems have viewers that support the visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well.

{{<section PNG>}}

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) refers to a type of raster image file format that uses lossless compression. This file format was created as a replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, the PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports lossless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved into one of the most used image file formats. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of the installation.

{{<section GIF>}}

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF images are compressed using the LZW lossless data compression technique that reduces the file size and does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image in contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and were compatible with graphics that consume solid areas of colour. For a long time, GIF was one of the most common formats on the Internet. GIFs are great for line art with limited colors, such as logos. They are popular on social networks and can be used for small animations and low-resolution video clips.

{{<section TIFF>}}

TIFF (Tag Image File Format or Tagged Image File Format) represents raster images that are meant for usage on various devices that comply with this file format standard. TIFF is a graphics format developed by Adobe in 1987 as one of the basic universal formats for the presentation of high-quality images used in the printing industry. Now TIFF has become a popular format for storing deep color images. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is not machine-dependent and is free from bounds like processors, operating systems, or file systems.

{{<section BMP>}}

BMP (Microsoft Windows Bitmap) is a bitmap image file format where the image is stored as a two-dimensional array of pixels, each pixel having its own color in RGB color model. Files having extension .BMP are used to store virtually any type of bitmap data. These images are independent of the graphics adapter and are also called device-independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochromes as well as color formats with various colour depths. Although BMP is based on Windows internal bitmap data structures, it is supported by many non-Windows and non-PC applications.

{{<section ICO>}}

The ICO file format is an image file format for computer icons in Microsoft Windows. ICO files contain one or more small images of varying sizes and color depths so that they can be scaled appropriately. ICO images come in different size, colour support and resolution to suit the requirements of the display. On Windows, all executable files that display an icon for the user on the desktop, start menu, or Windows Explorer must have an icon in ICO format. In terms of the structure, the images in the ICO file are the closest to BMP, but fundamentally different from them in the presence of an additional image - a mask superimposed on the background with the help of bit operations, which allows you to realize transparency of the image.

{{<section Image>}}

There are two main types of digital image files — raster and vector. Popular types of raster images include JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and GIF file formats. A bitmap is a two-dimensional array that maps colors to pixels at a particular location. A raster image is a much larger file than a vector one. Raster formats are suitable for photographs or pictures with color gradients. But one of their main disadvantages is losing quality when scaling. Because the pixel number is fixed, raster images can become distorted or blurry when resized to fill a bigger or smaller space. Increasing the size of an image with too few pixels can cause pixelation, which isn’t usually desirable.
