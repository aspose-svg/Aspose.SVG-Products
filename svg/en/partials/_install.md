Install from command line as ```nuget install Aspose.SVG``` or via Package Manager Console of Visual Studio with ```Install-Package Aspose.SVG```.
Alternatively, get the offline MSI installer or DLLs in a ZIP file from [downloads.](https://releases.aspose.com/svg/net/) Aspose.SVG for .NET API is a standalone library and does not depend on any software for SVG document processing.
