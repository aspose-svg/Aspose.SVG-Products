Q2: "Why is Base64 Encoding needed?"
A2: "Historically, many data transfer and storage formats use text instead of binary code (HTML, XML, e-mail, and so on). What if the data transfer format is text-based, but you require to transfer the binary data? This is where Base64 encoding comes in. To prevent misinterpretation of binary symbols when sending data over the Internet, it is necessary to encode them into characters. Some typical applications of Base64 Encoding: data URI schemes for images (CSS, HTML, JavaScript); transferring pictures and other binary data to XML; storing images in a database; including images into email messages."
Q3: "What browsers support Data URIs?"
A3: "Data URI is the fastest and easiest way to embed images and other files on your web pages. Data URI is supported by major modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, and IE8+."
