{{<section HEX>}}

HEX codes are the most used color codes. HEX codes are nothing more than a hexadecimal representation of RGB. The six-digit color number is structured into three groups of two digits which specify the amount of Red, Green, and Blue in the additive color. Each two-digit hex pair can have a value from 00 to FF. This gives over 16 million possible colors. If each of the three groups contains characters, such as #RRGGBB, then they can be written as #RGB.

{{<section CMYK>}}

CMYK colors are a combination of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK. This model is known as subtractive, as inks subtract the colors from white. CMYK is one of the most popular color models. The CMYK color model is used in printing inks for paper. This model includes many colors, but the number of colors is limited compared to RGB. CMYK is widely used while creating designs for printing to ensure that the desired colors are accurate and never for style sheets or HTML. CMYK is not supported in HTML, but it is suggested as a new standard in CSS4.
