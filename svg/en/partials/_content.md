h2: Pros and Cons of Data URI
---

The data URI gives us a wise way to embed images on a web page. URI schemes can be used in many ways. But in any case, there are pros and cons.

<b>Pros:</b>
- Speeding ​​up page loading. The browser doesn't need to make an additional web request to retrieve the file because the image is already embedded in the HTML document.
- Performance improvement. The browser requires less CPU time.
- Web pages become independent of external files, making them easy to share even offline.

<b>Cons:</b>
- The size of Base64 encoded data is 1/3 larger than the binary image.
- The encoded images are not cached by the browser and will be downloaded each time such a page is visited.
- Encoded images are difficult to edit because the Base64 string needs to be decoded first.
- A Base64 image will never be indexed by Google because it doesn't appear in image search results.
