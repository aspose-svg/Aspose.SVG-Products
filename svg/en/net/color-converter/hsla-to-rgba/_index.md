[Aspose.SVG for .NET API](https://products.aspose.com/svg/net/) offers a high-speed C# library that you can use for different SVG parsing tasks. One of the API features is easy access to work with several color spaces. The Aspose.Svg.Converters namespace implements easy access to [ColorConverter](https://reference.aspose.com/svg/net/aspose.svg.converters/colorconverter/) class that parses colors (RGB, HEX, HSL, HWB, CMYK, NCOL, LCH, OKLCH, LAB, OKLAB) from a string and returns the IConvertibleColor interface for converting to various color spaces.<br><br>
Colors codes or color formats are closely linked to the methods of describing and defining colors and are widely used in the web, design, polygraphy, photography, arts, etc. And for different tasks, different color formats are preferred. So, sometimes you may need to convert color codes.

If you need to convert colors from one color model to another, use our free online tool! It supports various color spaces, including HEX, RGB, CMYK, etc. You simply need to enter the color value for conversion! Click inside the color area to select a color, or enter a color code in the Input text box. You will immediately see other color codes for chosen color in the Output section.

{{< app/svg/color id=1 input="HSL" output="RGB">}}
// Parse HSLA color from a string
var color = ColorConverter.ConvertFrom("hsla(31.034, 57%, 70%, 0.2)");

// Convert HSLA to RGBA 
string rgbaColor = color.ToRgbaString();

// Print the result into console
Console.WriteLine(rgbaColor);
//result should be: rgba(222, 180, 134, 0.2)

h2: How to convert HSLA to RGBA using C#
---

If you want to use the conversion functions in your product or programmatically convert HSLA to RGBA, see the C# code example above. Color conversion can be done with a few lines of code:

1. Call the [ConvertFrom()](https://reference.aspose.com/svg/net/aspose.svg.converters/colorconverter/convertfrom/) method of the ColorConverter class and pass the HSLA code as a string. 
2. The ConvertFrom() method parses color from string representation and returns the [IConvertibleColor](https://reference.aspose.com/svg/net/aspose.svg.drawing/iconvertiblecolor/) interface to convert it to the required color spaces.
3. The IConvertibleColor.ToRgbaString() method converts HSLA to RGBA color in the format: rgba(0,0,0,0).
